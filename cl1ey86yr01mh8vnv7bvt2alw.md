Hello There üëã. I am Vaibhav. I am an Android Developer, currently an engineering student üë®‚Äçüéì with a knack towards software development and everything about technology. I am very excited to share my journey building this project for [Hasura x Hashnode Hackathon](https://townhall.hashnode.com/hasura-hackathon)

# **Play unlimited Quizzes with you friends for free on ** Quizzify.

## Video Introduction üìπ

This is a small introduction video about Quizzify.

## A bit of background


I was just scrolling through Hashnode and the article of Hasura x Hashnode hackathon came on my feed. I felt I should give a shot at it.

Then I started brainstorming about what to build and then I got reminded of my school days when I used to challenge my friends in quiz, we had lots of fun playing it, we all would go through quiz books and videos and prepare, this was very fun to play and by playing this we improved our chances to qualify for the school quiz competition. Then I thought _"Why not make a quiz game for people to play and get 
some more general knowledge"_ . So, then I started to build a mobile quiz game which can be played with friends in real time, which would be a good time-pass as well as would help people gain some more general knowledge while enjoying the game.

**Quizzify not just a game which helps people have fun with their friends and pass their time, but also helps people gain more general knowledge whle having fun playing it.**

**Quizzify has a clean and simple user-friendly interface which makes it easier for people of all age group to use it**

**Quizzify has various quiz categories, a lot of community made quizzes as well as instant quiz which is fetched from a public API**

### UI Designs

Before starting with the project I started with the UI designing, and this is one of the toughest part in building a project. Mostly selecting the right illustrations and icons.

These are the some of the designs I made in Adobe XD.

### Hasura GraphQL
  
#### **These are some of my GraphQL queries**

##### This is how I am fetching all quizzes

```graphql
query GetAllQuizzes {
    quiz {
        category {
            id
            image
            name
        }
        createdBy
        createdByUserId
        description
        id
        name
        questions
        votes
        timestamp
    }
}

```

##### This is how im saving quizzes

```graphql
mutation SaveNewQuiz(
    $id:String,
    $categoryId:String,
    $createdBy:String,
    $createdByUserId:String,
    $description:String,
    $name:String,
    $questions:String,
    $votes:Int,
    $timestamp:String
) {
    insert_quiz_one(object: {
        id: $id,
        categoryId: $categoryId,
        createdBy: $createdBy,
        createdByUserId: $createdByUserId,
        description: $description,
        name: $name,
        questions: $questions,
        votes: $votes,
        timestamp:$timestamp
    }){
        id
    }
}
```

##### This is how I'm observing games.
``` graph
subscription ObserveGame($gameId: String!) {
    game_by_pk(gameId: $gameId) {
        gameId
        gameState
        hostId
        inviteCode
        players
        quiz
        timestamp
    }
}
```

### Challenges I faced and how I solved them ‚úÖ

**Developing a software is full of challenges and twists and turns.**

- Working with GraphQL was a bit tricky in the beginning as it was the first time I tried something other than a REST Api. Setting up the GraphQL support in Android using Apollo-Kotlin was a bit tricky as well.
Very thanks to Apollo Kotlin and Hasura documentation, which made the integration easy.
  
- Handling the real-time quiz game feature was quite difficult to manage, it was also my first time making an app which has some real-time feature. After few days of scratching my head I finally figure out how to handle all states of the Game, like one of the players finished game, one player has moved up in the leaderboard, player leaving the game, host leaving the game which should end game for all users, and many more such states. üéâ


### Future Improvements üåü

- Adding more features like adding friends in app so users can directly invite friends rather than sharing the invite code with them.
- Add Chat support so users can chat while playing Game.
- Better handling of the unexpected errors than can occur while game is being played, like sudden loss of internet etc.
- Making the app completely offline ready so users can play quiz alone in offline mode and the result gets uploaded to the server as soon as internet comes using Work Manager API in Android.
- Improve the EXP ranking system in app and add some Global leaderboard kind of feature.
- Fine tuning the UX part of the app.


### Source Code üë©‚Äçüíª
