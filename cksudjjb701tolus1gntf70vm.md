Hello There üëã. I am Vaibhav. I am an Android Developer, currently a student üë®‚Äçüéì with a knack towards software development and everything about technology. I am very excited to share my journey building this project for [Auth0 + Hashnode Hackathon](https://townhall.hashnode.com/auth0-hackathon)

# Healthify **is here to help you track your daily water intake and sleep and boost your efficiency**.

## Video Introduction üìπ

This is a small introduction video about Healthify.

## A bit of background

I always felt that I am not drinking enough water daily because I am so busy at work that I never notice. I also used to feel that I am not getting enough sleep because I work late night. Having such lifestyle affects our health in the long run, it decreases our productivity and also weakens our health.

I used to feel like

Then for a few days I started tracking my water intake and my sleep and I felt more active and productive. As developers we need to work a lot, we should try to keep ourselves healthy, this will help us get better at work too. It's a good thing to stay hydrated and get sufficient amount of sleep each day. 

Then I started to feel like

I was just scrolling through Hashnode and the article of Auth0 x Hashnode hackathon came on my feed. I felt I should give a shot at it.

Then I started brainstorming about what to build and then I though to make an app which helps people stay hydrated and maintain a good sleep amount.
But then I thought that - *"Why would people even use it , when they can just use a notepad app to note down their water intake and sleep"* ü§î

But people cant see an overview of how they much water they drank and hours they slept each week and see statistics of it. Healthify also has a XP based ranking system which will drive people to meet their daily goals hence making it their habit to drink sufficient amount of water and get good sleep.

**Healthify not just helps people to track their water intake and sleep, but also shows you a detail view of water intake and sleep in the last week. Healthify also has a ranking system which will drive users to meet their daily goals to compete hence making it their habit to drink water and get enough sleep**

**Healthify has a clean and simple user-friendly interface which makes it easier for people of all age group to use it**

**Healthify reminds you to drink water by sending a notification after 1 hour of your last tracked water intake**

### UI Designs

Before starting with the project I started with the UI designing, and this is one of the toughest part in building a project. Mostly selecting the right illustrations and icons.

These are the designs I made in Adobe XD

**Healthify** has a XP based ranking system which ranks you among other users. XP can be gained by adding water and sleep. Having such ranking system in this app will make users compete and hence make it a habit of users to drink water and get enough sleep

#### **This is how I authenticate users using Auth0**


```kotlin
private fun loginUser() {
    viewModel.startLoading()
    WebAuthProvider
        .login(auth0)
        .withScheme(getString(R.string.scheme))
        .withScope("openid profile email read:current_user update:current_user_metadata")
        .start(
            requireContext(),
            object : Callback<Credentials, AuthenticationException> {
                override fun onFailure(error: AuthenticationException) {
                    viewModel.sendError(error.message.toString())
                }

                override fun onSuccess(result: Credentials) {
                    getUserProfile(result.accessToken)
                }
            }
        )
}

```

#### **This is how I am getting user profile data using auth0**

This is how I get user data from my fragment and send it to viewModel to get data from database

```kotlin
 private fun getUserProfile(accessToken: String) {
    val client = AuthenticationAPIClient(auth0)
    client.userInfo(accessToken)
        .start(object : Callback<UserProfile, AuthenticationException> {
            override fun onFailure(error: AuthenticationException) {
                viewModel.sendError(error.message.toString())
            }

            override fun onSuccess(result: UserProfile) {
                viewModel.saveUser(result)
                viewModel.loginComplete()
            }
        })
}

```

#### This is how I'm logging out users from my app.
```kotlin
private fun logoutUser() {
    WebAuthProvider
        .logout(auth0)
        .withScheme(getString(R.string.scheme))
        .start(
            requireContext(),
            object : Callback<Void?, AuthenticationException> {
                override fun onFailure(error: AuthenticationException) {
                    viewModel.logoutFailed()
                }

                override fun onSuccess(result: Void?) {
                    viewModel.logoutComplete()
                }
            }
        )
}
```

### Challenges I faced and how I solved them ‚úÖ

**Developing a software is full of challenges and twists and turns.**

- Making the notifications to remind user to drink after after every 1 hour of the last water intake was a difficult thing to implement, mainly handling case when user adds another water intake before the 1 hour interval. I figured it out by cancelling the old alarm when a new water intake is tracker and add new alarm for it. üéâ
  
- Making such complex UI in Android's XML design system is a very difficult thing and also handling light and dark theme together was also quite tough. I figured out a way to manage both UI's by maintaining two separate colors.xml to set the colors and same for styles.xml and drawable files. üéâ
  
- The Statistics screen was also quite a tricky part, mainly customizing the graphs according to my designs was a very difficult thing to do as the library had almost no documentation. After some hours of researching into its code I found out the exact properties to alter to make it look close to what I wanted it to. üéâ

### Future Improvements üåü

- Adding more features to track like protein intake , calorie tracking and many more
- Having a smart watch version of this app will be the cherry on the cake.
- Making the app completely offline ready so users can add water/sleep while being offline and as soon as the phone is online, data will get synced with the remote database
- Improve the Statistics section a bit.
- Improving the XP ranking system.
